# **WellNest - Health & Well-Being Open Source Discovery**  

## **Overview**  
The **Health & Well-Being Open Source Discovery** project helps open-source maintainers and contributors align their projects with the **United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, specifically **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**.  

With over **300 million open-source projects on GitHub**, many contribute to global health and well-being, but **there is no standardized method to identify or measure their impact**. This project provides a structured workflow to help maintainers classify their projects and generate machine-readable metadata to improve **discovery, funding, and collaboration**.  

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Developed in collaboration with the **GW Open Source Program Office (OSPO)** and the **United Nations**, this initiative aims to create a seamless workflow that allows open-source projects to:  

- Identify their alignment with **SDG 3** (Good Health and Well-Being).  
- Generate standardized metadata files (`code.json`, `yaml`, `markdown`).  
- Automate contributions to project repositories.  
- Improve discoverability through a centralized **searchable dashboard**.  

---

## **Features & Workflow**  

### **Phase 1: Metadata Extraction**  
- Users provide a **GitHub repository link**.  
- An **LLM-based parser** extracts project information from the `README.md`.  
- If missing data exists, the user answers simple **guided questions**.  

### **Phase 2: Code Metadata Generation**  
- The system generates a `code.json` file containing **structured project metadata**.  
- This metadata follows standardized formats to ensure compatibility with **funding agencies, researchers, and contributors**.  

### **Phase 3: Automated Contribution**  
- A **Pull Request (PR)** is automatically generated to add the `code.json` file to the repository.  
- Maintainers can review, approve, or modify the metadata before merging.  
- If PRs are not accepted, users can **manually download the metadata**.  

### **Phase 4: Project Discovery Dashboard**  
- A **searchable, filterable dashboard** is created to list categorized projects.  
- Users can explore projects by **impact area, programming language, contributor base, and funding potential**.  
- The dashboard enables funders, developers, and organizations to **find and support impactful projects**.
